# Problems

1. How do you access the 4th element of an array or slice?



2. What is the length of a slice created using: `make([]int, 3, 9`?

3. Given the array: `x := [6]string{"a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"}` what would `x[2:5]` give you?

4. Write a program that finds the smallest number in this list:

```go
x := []int{
  48,96,86,68,
  57,82,63,70,
  37,34,83,27,
  19,97, 9,17,
}
